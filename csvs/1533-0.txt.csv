I,I,3,SECOND WITCH,1533-0.txt,128,"When the hurlyburly’s done,"
I,I,4,SECOND WITCH,1533-0.txt,129,When the battle’s lost and won.
I,I,5,THIRD WITCH,1533-0.txt,132,That will be ere the set of sun.
I,I,6,FIRST WITCH,1533-0.txt,135,Where the place?
I,I,7,SECOND WITCH,1533-0.txt,138,Upon the heath.
I,I,8,THIRD WITCH,1533-0.txt,141,There to meet with Macbeth.
I,I,9,FIRST WITCH,1533-0.txt,144,"I come, Graymalkin!"
I,I,10,SECOND WITCH,1533-0.txt,147,Paddock calls.
I,I,11,THIRD WITCH,1533-0.txt,150,Anon.

I,II,1,DUNCAN,1533-0.txt,164,"What bloody man is that? He can report,"
I,II,2,DUNCAN,1533-0.txt,165,"As seemeth by his plight, of the revolt"
I,II,3,DUNCAN,1533-0.txt,166,The newest state.
I,II,4,MALCOLM,1533-0.txt,169,This is the sergeant
I,II,5,MALCOLM,1533-0.txt,170,"Who, like a good and hardy soldier, fought"
I,II,6,MALCOLM,1533-0.txt,171,"’Gainst my captivity.— Hail, brave friend!"
I,II,7,MALCOLM,1533-0.txt,172,Say to the King the knowledge of the broil
I,II,8,MALCOLM,1533-0.txt,173,As thou didst leave it.
I,II,9,SOLDIER,1533-0.txt,176,Doubtful it stood;
I,II,10,SOLDIER,1533-0.txt,177,As two spent swimmers that do cling together
I,II,11,SOLDIER,1533-0.txt,178,And choke their art. The merciless Macdonwald

I,II,16,SOLDIER,1533-0.txt,183,"And Fortune, on his damned quarrel smiling,"
I,II,17,SOLDIER,1533-0.txt,184,Show’d like a rebel’s whore. But all’s too weak;
I,II,18,SOLDIER,1533-0.txt,185,"For brave Macbeth (well he deserves that name),"
I,II,19,SOLDIER,1533-0.txt,186,"Disdaining Fortune, with his brandish’d steel,"
I,II,20,SOLDIER,1533-0.txt,187,"Which smok’d with bloody execution,"
I,II,21,SOLDIER,1533-0.txt,188,"Like Valour’s minion, carv’d out his passage,"
I,II,22,SOLDIER,1533-0.txt,189,Till he fac’d the slave;
I,II,23,SOLDIER,1533-0.txt,190,"Which ne’er shook hands, nor bade farewell to him,"
I,II,24,SOLDIER,1533-0.txt,191,"Till he unseam’d him from the nave to the chops,"
I,II,25,SOLDIER,1533-0.txt,192,And fix’d his head upon our battlements.
I,II,26,DUNCAN,1533-0.txt,195,O valiant cousin! worthy gentleman!
I,II,27,SOLDIER,1533-0.txt,198,As whence the sun ’gins his reflection

I,II,31,SOLDIER,1533-0.txt,202,"No sooner justice had, with valour arm’d,"
I,II,32,SOLDIER,1533-0.txt,203,"Compell’d these skipping kerns to trust their heels,"
I,II,33,SOLDIER,1533-0.txt,204,"But the Norweyan lord, surveying vantage,"
I,II,34,SOLDIER,1533-0.txt,205,"With furbish’d arms and new supplies of men,"
I,II,35,SOLDIER,1533-0.txt,206,Began a fresh assault.
I,II,36,DUNCAN,1533-0.txt,209,Dismay’d not this
I,II,37,DUNCAN,1533-0.txt,210,"Our captains, Macbeth and Banquo?"
I,II,38,SOLDIER,1533-0.txt,213,Yes;
I,II,39,SOLDIER,1533-0.txt,214,"As sparrows eagles, or the hare the lion."
I,II,40,SOLDIER,1533-0.txt,215,"If I say sooth, I must report they were"
I,II,41,SOLDIER,1533-0.txt,216,As cannons overcharg’d with double cracks;
I,II,42,SOLDIER,1533-0.txt,217,So they
I,II,43,SOLDIER,1533-0.txt,218,Doubly redoubled strokes upon the foe:
I,II,44,SOLDIER,1533-0.txt,219,"Except they meant to bathe in reeking wounds,"
I,II,45,SOLDIER,1533-0.txt,220,"Or memorize another Golgotha,"
I,II,46,SOLDIER,1533-0.txt,221,I cannot tell— 
I,II,47,SOLDIER,1533-0.txt,222,"But I am faint, my gashes cry for help."
I,II,48,DUNCAN,1533-0.txt,225,So well thy words become thee as thy wounds:

I,II,49,---,1533-0.txt,228,"[Exit Captain, attended.]"
I,II,49,---,1533-0.txt,230,Enter Ross and Angus.
I,II,50,DUNCAN,1533-0.txt,232,Who comes here?
I,II,51,MALCOLM,1533-0.txt,235,The worthy Thane of Ross.
I,II,52,LENNOX,1533-0.txt,238,What a haste looks through his eyes! So should he look
I,II,53,LENNOX,1533-0.txt,239,That seems to speak things strange.
I,II,54,ROSS,1533-0.txt,242,God save the King!
I,II,55,DUNCAN,1533-0.txt,245,"Whence cam’st thou, worthy thane?"
I,II,56,ROSS,1533-0.txt,248,"From Fife, great King,"
I,II,57,ROSS,1533-0.txt,249,Where the Norweyan banners flout the sky
I,II,58,ROSS,1533-0.txt,250,And fan our people cold.
I,II,59,ROSS,1533-0.txt,251,"Norway himself, with terrible numbers,"
I,II,60,ROSS,1533-0.txt,252,"Assisted by that most disloyal traitor,"
I,II,61,ROSS,1533-0.txt,253,"The Thane of Cawdor, began a dismal conflict;"
I,II,62,ROSS,1533-0.txt,254,"Till that Bellona’s bridegroom, lapp’d in proof,"
I,II,63,ROSS,1533-0.txt,255,"Confronted him with self-comparisons,"
I,II,64,ROSS,1533-0.txt,256,"Point against point, rebellious arm ’gainst arm,"
I,II,65,ROSS,1533-0.txt,257,"Curbing his lavish spirit: and, to conclude,"
I,II,66,ROSS,1533-0.txt,258,The victory fell on us.
I,II,67,DUNCAN,1533-0.txt,261,Great happiness!
I,II,68,ROSS,1533-0.txt,264,That now
I,II,69,ROSS,1533-0.txt,265,"Sweno, the Norways’ king, craves composition;"
I,II,70,ROSS,1533-0.txt,266,Nor would we deign him burial of his men
I,II,71,ROSS,1533-0.txt,267,Till he disbursed at Saint Colme’s Inch
I,II,72,ROSS,1533-0.txt,268,Ten thousand dollars to our general use.
I,II,73,DUNCAN,1533-0.txt,271,No more that Thane of Cawdor shall deceive
I,II,74,DUNCAN,1533-0.txt,272,"Our bosom interest. Go pronounce his present death,"
I,II,75,DUNCAN,1533-0.txt,273,And with his former title greet Macbeth.
I,II,76,ROSS,1533-0.txt,276,I’ll see it done.

I,III,1,FIRST WITCH,1533-0.txt,288,"Where hast thou been, sister?"
I,III,2,SECOND WITCH,1533-0.txt,291,Killing swine.
I,III,3,THIRD WITCH,1533-0.txt,294,"Sister, where thou?"
I,III,4,FIRST WITCH,1533-0.txt,297,"A sailor’s wife had chestnuts in her lap,"
I,III,5,FIRST WITCH,1533-0.txt,298,"And mounch’d, and mounch’d, and mounch’d. “Give me,” quoth I."
I,III,6,FIRST WITCH,1533-0.txt,299,"“Aroint thee, witch!” the rump-fed ronyon cries."
I,III,7,FIRST WITCH,1533-0.txt,300,"Her husband’s to Aleppo gone, master o’ th’ _Tiger:_"
I,III,8,FIRST WITCH,1533-0.txt,301,"But in a sieve I’ll thither sail,"
I,III,9,FIRST WITCH,1533-0.txt,302,"And, like a rat without a tail,"
I,III,10,FIRST WITCH,1533-0.txt,303,"I’ll do, I’ll do, and I’ll do."
I,III,11,SECOND WITCH,1533-0.txt,306,I’ll give thee a wind.
I,III,12,FIRST WITCH,1533-0.txt,309,Th’art kind.
I,III,13,THIRD WITCH,1533-0.txt,312,And I another.
I,III,14,FIRST WITCH,1533-0.txt,315,"I myself have all the other,"
I,III,15,FIRST WITCH,1533-0.txt,316,"And the very ports they blow,"
I,III,16,FIRST WITCH,1533-0.txt,317,All the quarters that they know
I,III,17,FIRST WITCH,1533-0.txt,318,I’ the shipman’s card.
I,III,18,FIRST WITCH,1533-0.txt,319,I will drain him dry as hay:
I,III,19,FIRST WITCH,1533-0.txt,320,Sleep shall neither night nor day
I,III,20,FIRST WITCH,1533-0.txt,321,Hang upon his pent-house lid;
I,III,21,FIRST WITCH,1533-0.txt,322,He shall live a man forbid.
I,III,22,FIRST WITCH,1533-0.txt,323,"Weary sev’n-nights nine times nine,"
I,III,23,FIRST WITCH,1533-0.txt,324,"Shall he dwindle, peak, and pine:"
I,III,24,FIRST WITCH,1533-0.txt,325,"Though his bark cannot be lost,"
I,III,25,FIRST WITCH,1533-0.txt,326,Yet it shall be tempest-tost.
I,III,26,FIRST WITCH,1533-0.txt,327,Look what I have.
I,III,27,SECOND WITCH,1533-0.txt,330,"Show me, show me."
I,III,28,FIRST WITCH,1533-0.txt,333,"Here I have a pilot’s thumb,"
I,III,29,FIRST WITCH,1533-0.txt,334,Wrack’d as homeward he did come.
I,III,29,---,1533-0.txt,336,[Drum within.]
I,III,30,THIRD WITCH,1533-0.txt,339,"A drum, a drum!"
I,III,31,THIRD WITCH,1533-0.txt,340,Macbeth doth come.
I,III,32,ALL,1533-0.txt,343,"The Weird Sisters, hand in hand,"
I,III,33,ALL,1533-0.txt,344,"Posters of the sea and land,"

I,III,36,ALL,1533-0.txt,347,"And thrice again, to make up nine."
I,III,37,ALL,1533-0.txt,348,Peace!— the charm’s wound up.
I,III,37,---,1533-0.txt,350,Enter Macbeth and Banquo.
I,III,38,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,353,So foul and fair a day I have not seen.
I,III,39,BANQUO,1533-0.txt,356,"How far is’t call’d to Forres?— What are these,"
I,III,40,BANQUO,1533-0.txt,357,"So wither’d, and so wild in their attire,"
I,III,41,BANQUO,1533-0.txt,358,"That look not like the inhabitants o’ th’ earth,"
I,III,42,BANQUO,1533-0.txt,359,And yet are on’t?— Live you? or are you aught
I,III,43,BANQUO,1533-0.txt,360,"That man may question? You seem to understand me,"
I,III,44,BANQUO,1533-0.txt,361,By each at once her choppy finger laying
I,III,45,BANQUO,1533-0.txt,362,"Upon her skinny lips. You should be women,"
I,III,46,BANQUO,1533-0.txt,363,And yet your beards forbid me to interpret
I,III,47,BANQUO,1533-0.txt,364,That you are so.
I,III,48,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,367,"Speak, if you can;— what are you?"
I,III,49,FIRST WITCH,1533-0.txt,370,"All hail, Macbeth! hail to thee, Thane of Glamis!"
I,III,50,SECOND WITCH,1533-0.txt,373,"All hail, Macbeth! hail to thee, Thane of Cawdor!"
I,III,51,THIRD WITCH,1533-0.txt,376,"All hail, Macbeth! that shalt be king hereafter!"
I,III,52,BANQUO,1533-0.txt,379,"Good sir, why do you start and seem to fear"
I,III,53,BANQUO,1533-0.txt,380,"Things that do sound so fair?— I’ th’ name of truth,"
I,III,54,BANQUO,1533-0.txt,381,"Are ye fantastical, or that indeed"
I,III,55,BANQUO,1533-0.txt,382,Which outwardly ye show? My noble partner
I,III,56,BANQUO,1533-0.txt,383,You greet with present grace and great prediction
I,III,57,BANQUO,1533-0.txt,384,"Of noble having and of royal hope,"
I,III,58,BANQUO,1533-0.txt,385,That he seems rapt withal. To me you speak not.
I,III,59,BANQUO,1533-0.txt,386,"If you can look into the seeds of time,"
I,III,60,BANQUO,1533-0.txt,387,"And say which grain will grow, and which will not,"
I,III,61,BANQUO,1533-0.txt,388,"Speak then to me, who neither beg nor fear"
I,III,62,BANQUO,1533-0.txt,389,Your favours nor your hate.
I,III,63,FIRST WITCH,1533-0.txt,392,Hail!
I,III,64,SECOND WITCH,1533-0.txt,395,Hail!
I,III,65,THIRD WITCH,1533-0.txt,398,Hail!
I,III,66,FIRST WITCH,1533-0.txt,401,"Lesser than Macbeth, and greater."
I,III,67,SECOND WITCH,1533-0.txt,404,"Not so happy, yet much happier."
I,III,68,THIRD WITCH,1533-0.txt,407,"Thou shalt get kings, though thou be none:"
I,III,69,THIRD WITCH,1533-0.txt,408,"So all hail, Macbeth and Banquo!"
I,III,70,FIRST WITCH,1533-0.txt,411,"Banquo and Macbeth, all hail!"
I,III,71,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,414,"Stay, you imperfect speakers, tell me more."
I,III,72,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,415,By Sinel’s death I know I am Thane of Glamis;
I,III,73,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,416,"But how of Cawdor? The Thane of Cawdor lives,"
I,III,74,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,417,A prosperous gentleman; and to be king
I,III,75,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,418,"Stands not within the prospect of belief,"
I,III,76,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,419,No more than to be Cawdor. Say from whence
I,III,77,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,420,You owe this strange intelligence? or why
I,III,78,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,421,Upon this blasted heath you stop our way
I,III,79,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,422,"With such prophetic greeting?— Speak, I charge you."
I,III,79,---,1533-0.txt,424,[Witches vanish.]
I,III,80,BANQUO,1533-0.txt,427,"The earth hath bubbles, as the water has,"
I,III,81,BANQUO,1533-0.txt,428,And these are of them. Whither are they vanish’d?
I,III,82,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,431,"Into the air; and what seem’d corporal,"
I,III,83,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,432,Melted as breath into the wind.
I,III,84,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,433,Would they had stay’d!
I,III,85,BANQUO,1533-0.txt,436,Were such things here as we do speak about?
I,III,86,BANQUO,1533-0.txt,437,Or have we eaten on the insane root
I,III,87,BANQUO,1533-0.txt,438,That takes the reason prisoner?
I,III,88,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,441,Your children shall be kings.
I,III,89,BANQUO,1533-0.txt,444,You shall be king.
I,III,90,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,447,And Thane of Cawdor too; went it not so?
I,III,91,BANQUO,1533-0.txt,450,To the selfsame tune and words. Who’s here?
I,III,91,---,1533-0.txt,452,Enter Ross and Angus.
I,III,92,ROSS,1533-0.txt,455,"The King hath happily receiv’d, Macbeth,"
I,III,93,ROSS,1533-0.txt,456,"The news of thy success, and when he reads"
I,III,94,ROSS,1533-0.txt,457,"Thy personal venture in the rebels’ fight,"
I,III,95,ROSS,1533-0.txt,458,His wonders and his praises do contend
I,III,96,ROSS,1533-0.txt,459,"Which should be thine or his: silenc’d with that,"
I,III,97,ROSS,1533-0.txt,460,"In viewing o’er the rest o’ th’ selfsame day,"
I,III,98,ROSS,1533-0.txt,461,"He finds thee in the stout Norweyan ranks,"
I,III,99,ROSS,1533-0.txt,462,"Nothing afeard of what thyself didst make,"
I,III,100,ROSS,1533-0.txt,463,Strange images of death. As thick as tale
I,III,101,ROSS,1533-0.txt,464,Came post with post; and everyone did bear
I,III,102,ROSS,1533-0.txt,465,"Thy praises in his kingdom’s great defence,"
I,III,103,ROSS,1533-0.txt,466,And pour’d them down before him.
I,III,104,ANGUS,1533-0.txt,469,We are sent
I,III,105,ANGUS,1533-0.txt,470,To give thee from our royal master thanks;
I,III,106,ANGUS,1533-0.txt,471,"Only to herald thee into his sight,"
I,III,107,ANGUS,1533-0.txt,472,Not pay thee.
I,III,108,ROSS,1533-0.txt,475,"And, for an earnest of a greater honour,"
I,III,109,ROSS,1533-0.txt,476,"He bade me, from him, call thee Thane of Cawdor:"
I,III,110,ROSS,1533-0.txt,477,"In which addition, hail, most worthy thane,"
I,III,111,ROSS,1533-0.txt,478,For it is thine.
I,III,112,BANQUO,1533-0.txt,481,"What, can the devil speak true?"
I,III,113,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,484,The Thane of Cawdor lives: why do you dress me
I,III,114,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,485,In borrow’d robes?
I,III,115,ANGUS,1533-0.txt,488,"Who was the Thane lives yet,"
I,III,116,ANGUS,1533-0.txt,489,But under heavy judgement bears that life
I,III,117,ANGUS,1533-0.txt,490,Which he deserves to lose. Whether he was combin’d
I,III,118,ANGUS,1533-0.txt,491,"With those of Norway, or did line the rebel"
I,III,119,ANGUS,1533-0.txt,492,"With hidden help and vantage, or that with both"
I,III,120,ANGUS,1533-0.txt,493,"He labour’d in his country’s wrack, I know not;"
I,III,121,ANGUS,1533-0.txt,494,"But treasons capital, confess’d and prov’d,"
I,III,122,ANGUS,1533-0.txt,495,Have overthrown him.
I,III,123,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,498,"[Aside.] Glamis, and Thane of Cawdor:"
I,III,124,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,499,The greatest is behind. [To Ross and Angus.] Thanks for your pains.
I,III,125,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,500,"[To Banquo.] Do you not hope your children shall be kings,"
I,III,126,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,501,When those that gave the Thane of Cawdor to me
I,III,127,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,502,Promis’d no less to them?
I,III,128,BANQUO,1533-0.txt,505,"That, trusted home,"
I,III,129,BANQUO,1533-0.txt,506,"Might yet enkindle you unto the crown,"
I,III,130,BANQUO,1533-0.txt,507,Besides the Thane of Cawdor. But ’tis strange:
I,III,131,BANQUO,1533-0.txt,508,"And oftentimes to win us to our harm,"
I,III,132,BANQUO,1533-0.txt,509,The instruments of darkness tell us truths;
I,III,133,BANQUO,1533-0.txt,510,"Win us with honest trifles, to betray’s"
I,III,134,BANQUO,1533-0.txt,511,In deepest consequence.— 
I,III,135,BANQUO,1533-0.txt,512,"Cousins, a word, I pray you."

I,VII,4,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,853,With his surcease success; that but this blow
I,VII,5,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,854,"Might be the be-all and the end-all— here,"
I,VII,6,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,855,"But here, upon this bank and shoal of time,"
I,VII,7,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,856,We’d jump the life to come. But in these cases
I,VII,8,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,857,We still have judgement here; that we but teach
I,VII,9,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,858,"Bloody instructions, which being taught, return"
I,VII,10,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,859,To plague th’ inventor. This even-handed justice
I,VII,11,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,860,Commends th’ ingredience of our poison’d chalice
I,VII,12,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,861,To our own lips. He’s here in double trust:
I,VII,13,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,862,"First, as I am his kinsman and his subject,"
I,VII,14,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,863,"Strong both against the deed; then, as his host,"
I,VII,15,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,864,"Who should against his murderer shut the door,"
I,VII,16,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,865,"Not bear the knife myself. Besides, this Duncan"
I,VII,17,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,866,"Hath borne his faculties so meek, hath been"
I,VII,18,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,867,"So clear in his great office, that his virtues"
I,VII,19,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,868,"Will plead like angels, trumpet-tongued, against"
I,VII,20,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,869,The deep damnation of his taking-off;

I,VII,23,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,872,"Upon the sightless couriers of the air,"
I,VII,24,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,873,"Shall blow the horrid deed in every eye,"
I,VII,25,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,874,That tears shall drown the wind.— I have no spur
I,VII,26,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,875,"To prick the sides of my intent, but only"
I,VII,27,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,876,"Vaulting ambition, which o’erleaps itself"
I,VII,28,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,877,And falls on th’ other— 
I,VII,28,---,1533-0.txt,879,Enter Lady Macbeth.
I,VII,29,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,881,How now! what news?
I,VII,30,LADY MACBETH,1533-0.txt,884,He has almost supp’d. Why have you left the chamber?
I,VII,31,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,887,Hath he ask’d for me?
I,VII,32,LADY MACBETH,1533-0.txt,890,Know you not he has?
I,VII,33,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,893,We will proceed no further in this business:
I,VII,34,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,894,He hath honour’d me of late; and I have bought
I,VII,35,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,895,"Golden opinions from all sorts of people,"
I,VII,36,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,896,"Which would be worn now in their newest gloss,"
I,VII,37,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,897,Not cast aside so soon.
I,VII,38,LADY MACBETH,1533-0.txt,900,Was the hope drunk
I,VII,39,LADY MACBETH,1533-0.txt,901,Wherein you dress’d yourself? Hath it slept since?
I,VII,40,LADY MACBETH,1533-0.txt,902,"And wakes it now, to look so green and pale"
I,VII,41,LADY MACBETH,1533-0.txt,903,At what it did so freely? From this time
I,VII,42,LADY MACBETH,1533-0.txt,904,Such I account thy love. Art thou afeard
I,VII,43,LADY MACBETH,1533-0.txt,905,To be the same in thine own act and valour
I,VII,44,LADY MACBETH,1533-0.txt,906,As thou art in desire? Wouldst thou have that
I,VII,45,LADY MACBETH,1533-0.txt,907,"Which thou esteem’st the ornament of life,"
I,VII,46,LADY MACBETH,1533-0.txt,908,"And live a coward in thine own esteem,"
I,VII,47,LADY MACBETH,1533-0.txt,909,"Letting “I dare not” wait upon “I would,”"
I,VII,48,LADY MACBETH,1533-0.txt,910,Like the poor cat i’ th’ adage?
I,VII,49,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,913,"Pr’ythee, peace!"
I,VII,50,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,914,I dare do all that may become a man;
I,VII,51,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,915,Who dares do more is none.
I,VII,52,LADY MACBETH,1533-0.txt,918,"What beast was’t, then,"
I,VII,53,LADY MACBETH,1533-0.txt,919,That made you break this enterprise to me?
I,VII,54,LADY MACBETH,1533-0.txt,920,"When you durst do it, then you were a man;"
I,VII,55,LADY MACBETH,1533-0.txt,921,"And, to be more than what you were, you would"
I,VII,56,LADY MACBETH,1533-0.txt,922,Be so much more the man. Nor time nor place
I,VII,57,LADY MACBETH,1533-0.txt,923,"Did then adhere, and yet you would make both:"
I,VII,58,LADY MACBETH,1533-0.txt,924,"They have made themselves, and that their fitness now"
I,VII,59,LADY MACBETH,1533-0.txt,925,"Does unmake you. I have given suck, and know"
I,VII,60,LADY MACBETH,1533-0.txt,926,How tender ’tis to love the babe that milks me:
I,VII,61,LADY MACBETH,1533-0.txt,927,"I would, while it was smiling in my face,"
I,VII,62,LADY MACBETH,1533-0.txt,928,Have pluck’d my nipple from his boneless gums
I,VII,63,LADY MACBETH,1533-0.txt,929,"And dash’d the brains out, had I so sworn as you"
I,VII,64,LADY MACBETH,1533-0.txt,930,Have done to this.
I,VII,65,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,933,If we should fail?
I,VII,66,LADY MACBETH,1533-0.txt,936,We fail?
I,VII,67,LADY MACBETH,1533-0.txt,937,"But screw your courage to the sticking-place,"
I,VII,68,LADY MACBETH,1533-0.txt,938,And we’ll not fail. When Duncan is asleep

I,VII,75,LADY MACBETH,1533-0.txt,945,"Their drenched natures lie as in a death,"
I,VII,76,LADY MACBETH,1533-0.txt,946,What cannot you and I perform upon

I,VII,78,LADY MACBETH,1533-0.txt,948,His spongy officers; who shall bear the guilt
I,VII,79,LADY MACBETH,1533-0.txt,949,Of our great quell?
I,VII,80,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,952,Bring forth men-children only;

I,VII,82,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,954,"Nothing but males. Will it not be receiv’d,"
I,VII,83,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,955,When we have mark’d with blood those sleepy two

I,VII,92,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,968,False face must hide what the false heart doth know.
I,VII,92,---,1533-0.txt,970,[Exeunt.]
II,I,0,---,1533-0.txt,977,Enter Banquo and Fleance with a torch before him.
II,I,1,BANQUO,1533-0.txt,980,"How goes the night, boy?"
II,I,2,FLEANCE,1533-0.txt,983,The moon is down; I have not heard the clock.
II,I,3,BANQUO,1533-0.txt,986,And she goes down at twelve.
II,I,4,FLEANCE,1533-0.txt,989,"I take’t, ’tis later, sir."
II,I,5,BANQUO,1533-0.txt,992,"Hold, take my sword.— There’s husbandry in heaven;"
II,I,6,BANQUO,1533-0.txt,993,Their candles are all out. Take thee that too.
II,I,7,BANQUO,1533-0.txt,994,"A heavy summons lies like lead upon me,"
II,I,8,BANQUO,1533-0.txt,995,"And yet I would not sleep. Merciful powers,"
II,I,9,BANQUO,1533-0.txt,996,Restrain in me the cursed thoughts that nature
II,I,10,BANQUO,1533-0.txt,997,Gives way to in repose!
II,I,10,---,1533-0.txt,999,Enter Macbeth and a Servant with a torch.
II,I,11,BANQUO,1533-0.txt,1001,Give me my sword.— Who’s there?
II,I,12,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,1004,A friend.
II,I,13,BANQUO,1533-0.txt,1007,"What, sir, not yet at rest? The King’s abed:"
II,I,14,BANQUO,1533-0.txt,1008,He hath been in unusual pleasure and
II,I,15,BANQUO,1533-0.txt,1009,Sent forth great largess to your offices.
II,I,16,BANQUO,1533-0.txt,1010,"This diamond he greets your wife withal,"
II,I,17,BANQUO,1533-0.txt,1011,"By the name of most kind hostess, and shut up"
II,I,18,BANQUO,1533-0.txt,1012,In measureless content.
II,I,19,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,1015,"Being unprepar’d,"
II,I,20,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,1016,"Our will became the servant to defect,"
II,I,21,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,1017,Which else should free have wrought.
II,I,22,BANQUO,1533-0.txt,1020,All’s well.
II,I,23,BANQUO,1533-0.txt,1021,I dreamt last night of the three Weird Sisters:
II,I,24,BANQUO,1533-0.txt,1022,To you they have show’d some truth.
II,I,25,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,1025,I think not of them:
II,I,26,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,1026,"Yet, when we can entreat an hour to serve,"
II,I,27,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,1027,"We would spend it in some words upon that business,"
II,I,28,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,1028,If you would grant the time.
II,I,29,BANQUO,1533-0.txt,1031,At your kind’st leisure.
II,I,30,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,1034,"If you shall cleave to my consent, when ’tis,"
II,I,31,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,1035,It shall make honour for you.
II,I,32,BANQUO,1533-0.txt,1038,So I lose none
II,I,33,BANQUO,1533-0.txt,1039,"In seeking to augment it, but still keep"
II,I,34,BANQUO,1533-0.txt,1040,"My bosom franchis’d, and allegiance clear,"
II,I,35,BANQUO,1533-0.txt,1041,I shall be counsell’d.
II,I,36,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,1044,Good repose the while!
II,I,37,BANQUO,1533-0.txt,1047,"Thanks, sir: the like to you."
II,I,37,---,1533-0.txt,1049,[Exeunt Banquo and Fleance.]
II,I,38,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,1052,"Go bid thy mistress, when my drink is ready,"
II,I,39,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,1053,She strike upon the bell. Get thee to bed.
II,I,39,---,1533-0.txt,1055,[Exit Servant.]
II,I,40,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,1057,"Is this a dagger which I see before me,"
II,I,41,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,1058,"The handle toward my hand? Come, let me clutch thee:— "
II,I,42,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,1059,"I have thee not, and yet I see thee still."
II,I,43,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,1060,"Art thou not, fatal vision, sensible"
II,I,44,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,1061,To feeling as to sight? or art thou but
II,I,45,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,1062,"A dagger of the mind, a false creation,"
II,I,46,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,1063,Proceeding from the heat-oppressed brain?
II,I,47,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,1064,"I see thee yet, in form as palpable"
II,I,48,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,1065,As this which now I draw.
II,I,49,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,1066,Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going;
II,I,50,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,1067,And such an instrument I was to use.
II,I,51,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,1068,"Mine eyes are made the fools o’ the other senses,"
II,I,52,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,1069,Or else worth all the rest: I see thee still;
II,I,53,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,1070,"And on thy blade and dudgeon, gouts of blood,"
II,I,54,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,1071,Which was not so before.— There’s no such thing.
II,I,55,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,1072,It is the bloody business which informs
II,I,56,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,1073,Thus to mine eyes.— Now o’er the one half-world
II,I,57,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,1074,"Nature seems dead, and wicked dreams abuse"
II,I,58,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,1075,The curtain’d sleep. Witchcraft celebrates
II,I,59,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,1076,"Pale Hecate’s off’rings; and wither’d murder,"
II,I,60,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,1077,"Alarum’d by his sentinel, the wolf,"
II,I,61,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,1078,"Whose howl’s his watch, thus with his stealthy pace,"
II,I,62,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,1079,"With Tarquin’s ravishing strides, towards his design"
II,I,63,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,1080,"Moves like a ghost.— Thou sure and firm-set earth,"
II,I,64,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,1081,"Hear not my steps, which way they walk, for fear"
II,I,65,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,1082,"Thy very stones prate of my whereabout,"
II,I,66,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,1083,"And take the present horror from the time,"
II,I,67,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,1084,"Which now suits with it.— Whiles I threat, he lives."
II,I,68,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,1085,Words to the heat of deeds too cold breath gives.
II,I,68,---,1533-0.txt,1087,[A bell rings.]
II,I,69,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,1089,"I go, and it is done. The bell invites me."
II,I,70,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,1090,"Hear it not, Duncan, for it is a knell"
II,I,71,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,1091,That summons thee to heaven or to hell.
II,I,71,---,1533-0.txt,1093,[Exit.]
II,II,0,---,1533-0.txt,1097,Enter Lady Macbeth.
II,II,1,LADY MACBETH,1533-0.txt,1100,That which hath made them drunk hath made me bold:
II,II,2,LADY MACBETH,1533-0.txt,1101,What hath quench’d them hath given me fire.— Hark!— Peace!
II,II,3,LADY MACBETH,1533-0.txt,1102,"It was the owl that shriek’d, the fatal bellman,"
II,II,4,LADY MACBETH,1533-0.txt,1103,Which gives the stern’st good night. He is about it.
II,II,5,LADY MACBETH,1533-0.txt,1104,The doors are open; and the surfeited grooms
II,II,6,LADY MACBETH,1533-0.txt,1105,"Do mock their charge with snores: I have drugg’d their possets,"
II,II,7,LADY MACBETH,1533-0.txt,1106,"That death and nature do contend about them,"
II,II,8,LADY MACBETH,1533-0.txt,1107,Whether they live or die.
II,II,9,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,1110,"[Within.] Who’s there?— what, ho!"
II,II,10,LADY MACBETH,1533-0.txt,1113,"Alack! I am afraid they have awak’d,"
II,II,11,LADY MACBETH,1533-0.txt,1114,And ’tis not done. Th’ attempt and not the deed
II,II,12,LADY MACBETH,1533-0.txt,1115,Confounds us.— Hark!— I laid their daggers ready;
II,II,13,LADY MACBETH,1533-0.txt,1116,He could not miss ’em.— Had he not resembled
II,II,14,LADY MACBETH,1533-0.txt,1117,"My father as he slept, I had done’t.— My husband!"
II,II,14,---,1533-0.txt,1119,Enter Macbeth.
II,II,15,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,1122,I have done the deed.— Didst thou not hear a noise?
II,II,16,LADY MACBETH,1533-0.txt,1125,I heard the owl scream and the crickets cry.
II,II,17,LADY MACBETH,1533-0.txt,1126,Did not you speak?
II,II,18,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,1129,When?
II,II,19,LADY MACBETH,1533-0.txt,1132,Now.
II,II,20,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,1135,As I descended?
II,II,21,LADY MACBETH,1533-0.txt,1138,Ay.
II,II,22,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,1141,Hark!— Who lies i’ th’ second chamber?
II,II,23,LADY MACBETH,1533-0.txt,1144,Donalbain.
II,II,24,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,1147,This is a sorry sight.
II,II,24,---,1533-0.txt,1149,[Looking on his hands.]
II,II,25,LADY MACBETH,1533-0.txt,1152,"A foolish thought, to say a sorry sight."
II,II,26,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,1155,"There’s one did laugh in’s sleep, and one cried, “Murder!”"
II,II,27,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,1156,That they did wake each other: I stood and heard them.
II,II,28,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,1157,"But they did say their prayers, and address’d them"
II,II,29,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,1158,Again to sleep.
II,II,30,LADY MACBETH,1533-0.txt,1161,There are two lodg’d together.
II,II,31,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,1164,"One cried, “God bless us!” and, “Amen,” the other,"
II,II,32,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,1165,As they had seen me with these hangman’s hands.
II,II,33,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,1166,"List’ning their fear, I could not say “Amen,”"
II,II,34,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,1167,"When they did say, “God bless us.”"
II,II,35,LADY MACBETH,1533-0.txt,1170,Consider it not so deeply.
II,II,36,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,1173,But wherefore could not I pronounce “Amen”?
II,II,37,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,1174,"I had most need of blessing, and “Amen”"
II,II,38,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,1175,Stuck in my throat.
II,II,39,LADY MACBETH,1533-0.txt,1178,These deeds must not be thought
II,II,40,LADY MACBETH,1533-0.txt,1179,"After these ways; so, it will make us mad."
II,II,41,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,1182,"Methought I heard a voice cry, “Sleep no more!"

II,II,57,LADY MACBETH,1533-0.txt,1204,The sleepy grooms with blood.
II,II,58,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,1207,I’ll go no more:

II,II,60,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,1209,Look on’t again I dare not.
II,II,61,LADY MACBETH,1533-0.txt,1212,Infirm of purpose!
II,II,62,LADY MACBETH,1533-0.txt,1213,Give me the daggers. The sleeping and the dead

II,III,21,PORTER,1533-0.txt,1286,"Marry, sir, nose-painting, sleep, and urine. Lechery, sir, it provokes"
II,III,22,PORTER,1533-0.txt,1287,"and unprovokes; it provokes the desire, but it takes away the"
II,III,23,PORTER,1533-0.txt,1288,performance. Therefore much drink may be said to be an equivocator with
II,III,24,PORTER,1533-0.txt,1289,"lechery: it makes him, and it mars him; it sets him on, and it takes"
II,III,25,PORTER,1533-0.txt,1290,"him off; it persuades him, and disheartens him; makes him stand to, and"
II,III,26,PORTER,1533-0.txt,1291,"not stand to; in conclusion, equivocates him in a sleep, and giving him"
II,III,27,PORTER,1533-0.txt,1292,"the lie, leaves him."

II,III,37,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,1319,Not yet.
II,III,38,MACDUFF,1533-0.txt,1322,He did command me to call timely on him.

II,III,43,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,1333,The labour we delight in physics pain.
II,III,44,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,1334,This is the door.
II,III,45,MACDUFF,1533-0.txt,1337,I’ll make so bold to call.
II,III,46,MACDUFF,1533-0.txt,1338,For ’tis my limited service.

II,III,47,LENNOX,1533-0.txt,1343,Goes the King hence today?

III,III,5,SECOND MURDERER,1533-0.txt,2019,To the direction just.

III,III,28,FIRST MURDERER,1533-0.txt,2076,Was’t not the way?
III,III,29,THIRD MURDERER,1533-0.txt,2079,There’s but one down: the son is fled.
III,III,30,SECOND MURDERER,1533-0.txt,2082,We have lost best half of our affair.
III,III,31,FIRST MURDERER,1533-0.txt,2085,"Well, let’s away, and say how much is done."

III,IV,7,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,2105,We will require her welcome.
III,IV,8,LADY MACBETH,1533-0.txt,2108,"Pronounce it for me, sir, to all our friends;"

III,IV,11,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,2115,Both sides are even: here I’ll sit i’ th’ midst.
III,IV,12,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,2117,Be large in mirth; anon we’ll drink a measure
III,IV,13,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,2118,The table round. There’s blood upon thy face.
III,IV,14,MURDERER,1533-0.txt,2121,’Tis Banquo’s then.
III,IV,15,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,2124,’Tis better thee without than he within.

III,IV,18,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,2131,Thou art the best o’ th’ cut-throats;
III,IV,19,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,2132,Yet he’s good that did the like for Fleance:
III,IV,20,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,2133,"If thou didst it, thou art the nonpareil."
III,IV,21,MURDERER,1533-0.txt,2136,"Most royal sir,"
III,IV,22,MURDERER,1533-0.txt,2137,Fleance is ’scap’d.
III,IV,23,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,2140,Then comes my fit again: I had else been perfect;
III,IV,24,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,2141,"Whole as the marble, founded as the rock,"
III,IV,25,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,2142,As broad and general as the casing air:
III,IV,26,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,2143,"But now I am cabin’d, cribb’d, confin’d, bound in"
III,IV,27,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,2144,To saucy doubts and fears. But Banquo’s safe?
III,IV,28,MURDERER,1533-0.txt,2147,"Ay, my good lord. Safe in a ditch he bides,"
III,IV,29,MURDERER,1533-0.txt,2148,With twenty trenched gashes on his head;
III,IV,30,MURDERER,1533-0.txt,2149,The least a death to nature.
III,IV,31,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,2152,Thanks for that.
III,IV,32,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,2153,There the grown serpent lies; the worm that’s fled
III,IV,33,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,2154,"Hath nature that in time will venom breed,"
III,IV,34,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,2155,No teeth for th’ present.— Get thee gone; tomorrow

III,IV,39,LADY MACBETH,1533-0.txt,2164,’Tis given with welcome. To feed were best at home;

III,IV,47,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,2180,Were the grac’d person of our Banquo present;
III,IV,48,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,2181,Who may I rather challenge for unkindness
III,IV,49,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,2182,Than pity for mischance!
III,IV,50,ROSS,1533-0.txt,2185,"His absence, sir,"
III,IV,51,ROSS,1533-0.txt,2186,Lays blame upon his promise. Please’t your Highness
III,IV,52,ROSS,1533-0.txt,2187,To grace us with your royal company?
III,IV,53,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,2190,The table’s full.
III,IV,54,LENNOX,1533-0.txt,2193,"Here is a place reserv’d, sir."
III,IV,55,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,2196,Where?
III,IV,56,LENNOX,1533-0.txt,2199,"Here, my good lord. What is’t that moves your Highness?"
III,IV,57,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,2202,Which of you have done this?
III,IV,58,LORDS,1533-0.txt,2205,"What, my good lord?"
III,IV,59,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,2208,Thou canst not say I did it. Never shake
III,IV,60,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,2209,Thy gory locks at me.
III,IV,61,ROSS,1533-0.txt,2212,"Gentlemen, rise; his Highness is not well."
III,IV,62,LADY MACBETH,1533-0.txt,2215,"Sit, worthy friends. My lord is often thus,"
III,IV,63,LADY MACBETH,1533-0.txt,2216,"And hath been from his youth: pray you, keep seat;"

III,IV,68,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,2223,"Ay, and a bold one, that dare look on that"
III,IV,69,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,2224,Which might appal the devil.
III,IV,70,LADY MACBETH,1533-0.txt,2227,O proper stuff!
III,IV,71,LADY MACBETH,1533-0.txt,2228,This is the very painting of your fear:

IV,II,56,LADY MACDUFF,1533-0.txt,2942,Every one.
IV,II,57,SON,1533-0.txt,2945,Who must hang them?
IV,II,58,LADY MACDUFF,1533-0.txt,2948,"Why, the honest men."

IV,III,42,MACDUFF,1533-0.txt,3077,And the rich East to boot.
IV,III,43,MALCOLM,1533-0.txt,3080,Be not offended:
IV,III,44,MALCOLM,1533-0.txt,3081,I speak not as in absolute fear of you.
IV,III,45,MALCOLM,1533-0.txt,3082,I think our country sinks beneath the yoke;
IV,III,46,MALCOLM,1533-0.txt,3083,"It weeps, it bleeds; and each new day a gash"
IV,III,47,MALCOLM,1533-0.txt,3084,"Is added to her wounds. I think, withal,"
IV,III,48,MALCOLM,1533-0.txt,3085,There would be hands uplifted in my right;
IV,III,49,MALCOLM,1533-0.txt,3086,"And here, from gracious England, have I offer"
IV,III,50,MALCOLM,1533-0.txt,3087,"Of goodly thousands: but, for all this,"
IV,III,51,MALCOLM,1533-0.txt,3088,"When I shall tread upon the tyrant’s head,"
IV,III,52,MALCOLM,1533-0.txt,3089,"Or wear it on my sword, yet my poor country"
IV,III,53,MALCOLM,1533-0.txt,3090,"Shall have more vices than it had before,"
IV,III,54,MALCOLM,1533-0.txt,3091,"More suffer, and more sundry ways than ever,"
IV,III,55,MALCOLM,1533-0.txt,3092,By him that shall succeed.
IV,III,56,MACDUFF,1533-0.txt,3095,What should he be?
IV,III,57,MALCOLM,1533-0.txt,3098,It is myself I mean; in whom I know
IV,III,58,MALCOLM,1533-0.txt,3099,All the particulars of vice so grafted
IV,III,59,MALCOLM,1533-0.txt,3100,"That, when they shall be open’d, black Macbeth"
IV,III,60,MALCOLM,1533-0.txt,3101,Will seem as pure as snow; and the poor state
IV,III,61,MALCOLM,1533-0.txt,3102,"Esteem him as a lamb, being compar’d"
IV,III,62,MALCOLM,1533-0.txt,3103,With my confineless harms.
IV,III,63,MACDUFF,1533-0.txt,3106,Not in the legions
IV,III,64,MACDUFF,1533-0.txt,3107,Of horrid hell can come a devil more damn’d
IV,III,65,MACDUFF,1533-0.txt,3108,In evils to top Macbeth.
IV,III,66,MALCOLM,1533-0.txt,3111,"I grant him bloody,"
IV,III,67,MALCOLM,1533-0.txt,3112,"Luxurious, avaricious, false, deceitful,"
IV,III,68,MALCOLM,1533-0.txt,3113,"Sudden, malicious, smacking of every sin"
IV,III,69,MALCOLM,1533-0.txt,3114,"That has a name: but there’s no bottom, none,"
IV,III,70,MALCOLM,1533-0.txt,3115,"In my voluptuousness: your wives, your daughters,"
IV,III,71,MALCOLM,1533-0.txt,3116,"Your matrons, and your maids, could not fill up"
IV,III,72,MALCOLM,1533-0.txt,3117,The cistern of my lust; and my desire
IV,III,73,MALCOLM,1533-0.txt,3118,"All continent impediments would o’erbear,"
IV,III,74,MALCOLM,1533-0.txt,3119,That did oppose my will: better Macbeth
IV,III,75,MALCOLM,1533-0.txt,3120,Than such an one to reign.
IV,III,76,MACDUFF,1533-0.txt,3123,Boundless intemperance
IV,III,77,MACDUFF,1533-0.txt,3124,In nature is a tyranny; it hath been
IV,III,78,MACDUFF,1533-0.txt,3125,"Th’ untimely emptying of the happy throne,"
IV,III,79,MACDUFF,1533-0.txt,3126,And fall of many kings. But fear not yet
IV,III,80,MACDUFF,1533-0.txt,3127,To take upon you what is yours: you may
IV,III,81,MACDUFF,1533-0.txt,3128,"Convey your pleasures in a spacious plenty,"
IV,III,82,MACDUFF,1533-0.txt,3129,And yet seem cold— the time you may so hoodwink.
IV,III,83,MACDUFF,1533-0.txt,3130,We have willing dames enough; there cannot be
IV,III,84,MACDUFF,1533-0.txt,3131,"That vulture in you, to devour so many"
IV,III,85,MACDUFF,1533-0.txt,3132,"As will to greatness dedicate themselves,"
IV,III,86,MACDUFF,1533-0.txt,3133,Finding it so inclin’d.
IV,III,87,MALCOLM,1533-0.txt,3136,With this there grows
IV,III,88,MALCOLM,1533-0.txt,3137,In my most ill-compos’d affection such
IV,III,89,MALCOLM,1533-0.txt,3138,"A staunchless avarice, that, were I king,"
IV,III,90,MALCOLM,1533-0.txt,3139,I should cut off the nobles for their lands;
IV,III,91,MALCOLM,1533-0.txt,3140,"Desire his jewels, and this other’s house:"
IV,III,92,MALCOLM,1533-0.txt,3141,And my more-having would be as a sauce
IV,III,93,MALCOLM,1533-0.txt,3142,To make me hunger more; that I should forge
IV,III,94,MALCOLM,1533-0.txt,3143,"Quarrels unjust against the good and loyal,"
IV,III,95,MALCOLM,1533-0.txt,3144,Destroying them for wealth.
IV,III,96,MACDUFF,1533-0.txt,3147,This avarice
IV,III,97,MACDUFF,1533-0.txt,3148,Sticks deeper; grows with more pernicious root
IV,III,98,MACDUFF,1533-0.txt,3149,Than summer-seeming lust; and it hath been
IV,III,99,MACDUFF,1533-0.txt,3150,The sword of our slain kings: yet do not fear;
IV,III,100,MACDUFF,1533-0.txt,3151,"Scotland hath foisons to fill up your will,"
IV,III,101,MACDUFF,1533-0.txt,3152,"Of your mere own. All these are portable,"
IV,III,102,MACDUFF,1533-0.txt,3153,With other graces weigh’d.
IV,III,103,MALCOLM,1533-0.txt,3156,"But I have none: the king-becoming graces,"
IV,III,104,MALCOLM,1533-0.txt,3157,"As justice, verity, temp’rance, stableness,"
IV,III,105,MALCOLM,1533-0.txt,3158,"Bounty, perseverance, mercy, lowliness,"
IV,III,106,MALCOLM,1533-0.txt,3159,"Devotion, patience, courage, fortitude,"
IV,III,107,MALCOLM,1533-0.txt,3160,I have no relish of them; but abound
IV,III,108,MALCOLM,1533-0.txt,3161,"In the division of each several crime,"
IV,III,109,MALCOLM,1533-0.txt,3162,"Acting it many ways. Nay, had I power, I should"

IV,III,112,MALCOLM,1533-0.txt,3165,All unity on earth.
IV,III,113,MACDUFF,1533-0.txt,3168,"O Scotland, Scotland!"
IV,III,114,MALCOLM,1533-0.txt,3171,"If such a one be fit to govern, speak:"
IV,III,115,MALCOLM,1533-0.txt,3172,I am as I have spoken.
IV,III,116,MACDUFF,1533-0.txt,3175,Fit to govern?
IV,III,117,MACDUFF,1533-0.txt,3176,"No, not to live.— O nation miserable,"
IV,III,118,MACDUFF,1533-0.txt,3177,"With an untitled tyrant bloody-scepter’d,"
IV,III,119,MACDUFF,1533-0.txt,3178,"When shalt thou see thy wholesome days again,"
IV,III,120,MACDUFF,1533-0.txt,3179,Since that the truest issue of thy throne

IV,III,122,MACDUFF,1533-0.txt,3181,And does blaspheme his breed? Thy royal father

IV,III,124,MACDUFF,1533-0.txt,3183,"Oft’ner upon her knees than on her feet,"
IV,III,125,MACDUFF,1533-0.txt,3184,Died every day she lived. Fare thee well!
IV,III,126,MACDUFF,1533-0.txt,3185,These evils thou repeat’st upon thyself
IV,III,127,MACDUFF,1533-0.txt,3186,"Have banish’d me from Scotland.— O my breast,"
IV,III,128,MACDUFF,1533-0.txt,3187,Thy hope ends here!

IV,III,133,MALCOLM,1533-0.txt,3194,By many of these trains hath sought to win me
IV,III,134,MALCOLM,1533-0.txt,3195,"Into his power, and modest wisdom plucks me"
IV,III,135,MALCOLM,1533-0.txt,3196,From over-credulous haste: but God above

IV,III,137,MALCOLM,1533-0.txt,3198,"I put myself to thy direction, and"

IV,III,140,MALCOLM,1533-0.txt,3201,For strangers to my nature. I am yet
IV,III,141,MALCOLM,1533-0.txt,3202,Unknown to woman; never was forsworn;
IV,III,142,MALCOLM,1533-0.txt,3203,Scarcely have coveted what was mine own;
IV,III,143,MALCOLM,1533-0.txt,3204,At no time broke my faith; would not betray
IV,III,144,MALCOLM,1533-0.txt,3205,The devil to his fellow; and delight
IV,III,145,MALCOLM,1533-0.txt,3206,No less in truth than life: my first false speaking
IV,III,146,MALCOLM,1533-0.txt,3207,"Was this upon myself. What I am truly,"
IV,III,147,MALCOLM,1533-0.txt,3208,Is thine and my poor country’s to command:
IV,III,148,MALCOLM,1533-0.txt,3209,"Whither, indeed, before thy here-approach,"
IV,III,149,MALCOLM,1533-0.txt,3210,"Old Siward, with ten thousand warlike men,"
IV,III,150,MALCOLM,1533-0.txt,3211,"Already at a point, was setting forth."

IV,III,152,MALCOLM,1533-0.txt,3213,Be like our warranted quarrel. Why are you silent?
IV,III,153,MACDUFF,1533-0.txt,3216,Such welcome and unwelcome things at once
IV,III,154,MACDUFF,1533-0.txt,3217,’Tis hard to reconcile.
IV,III,154,---,1533-0.txt,3219,Enter a Doctor.
IV,III,155,MALCOLM,1533-0.txt,3222,"Well; more anon.— Comes the King forth, I pray you?"
IV,III,156,DOCTOR,1533-0.txt,3225,"Ay, sir. There are a crew of wretched souls"
IV,III,157,DOCTOR,1533-0.txt,3226,That stay his cure: their malady convinces
IV,III,158,DOCTOR,1533-0.txt,3227,"The great assay of art; but at his touch,"
IV,III,159,DOCTOR,1533-0.txt,3228,"Such sanctity hath heaven given his hand,"
IV,III,160,DOCTOR,1533-0.txt,3229,They presently amend.
IV,III,161,MALCOLM,1533-0.txt,3232,"I thank you, doctor."
IV,III,161,---,1533-0.txt,3234,[Exit Doctor.]
IV,III,162,MACDUFF,1533-0.txt,3237,What’s the disease he means?
IV,III,163,MALCOLM,1533-0.txt,3240,’Tis call’d the evil:
IV,III,164,MALCOLM,1533-0.txt,3241,A most miraculous work in this good king;
IV,III,165,MALCOLM,1533-0.txt,3242,"Which often, since my here-remain in England,"
IV,III,166,MALCOLM,1533-0.txt,3243,"I have seen him do. How he solicits heaven,"
IV,III,167,MALCOLM,1533-0.txt,3244,"Himself best knows, but strangely-visited people,"
IV,III,168,MALCOLM,1533-0.txt,3245,"All swoln and ulcerous, pitiful to the eye,"
IV,III,169,MALCOLM,1533-0.txt,3246,"The mere despair of surgery, he cures;"
IV,III,170,MALCOLM,1533-0.txt,3247,"Hanging a golden stamp about their necks,"
IV,III,171,MALCOLM,1533-0.txt,3248,"Put on with holy prayers: and ’tis spoken,"
IV,III,172,MALCOLM,1533-0.txt,3249,To the succeeding royalty he leaves
IV,III,173,MALCOLM,1533-0.txt,3250,"The healing benediction. With this strange virtue,"
IV,III,174,MALCOLM,1533-0.txt,3251,He hath a heavenly gift of prophecy;
IV,III,175,MALCOLM,1533-0.txt,3252,"And sundry blessings hang about his throne,"
IV,III,176,MALCOLM,1533-0.txt,3253,That speak him full of grace.
IV,III,176,---,1533-0.txt,3255,Enter Ross.
IV,III,177,MACDUFF,1533-0.txt,3258,"See, who comes here?"
IV,III,178,MALCOLM,1533-0.txt,3261,My countryman; but yet I know him not.
IV,III,179,MACDUFF,1533-0.txt,3264,"My ever-gentle cousin, welcome hither."
IV,III,180,MALCOLM,1533-0.txt,3267,"I know him now. Good God, betimes remove"
IV,III,181,MALCOLM,1533-0.txt,3268,The means that makes us strangers!
IV,III,182,ROSS,1533-0.txt,3271,"Sir, amen."
IV,III,183,MACDUFF,1533-0.txt,3274,Stands Scotland where it did?
IV,III,184,ROSS,1533-0.txt,3277,"Alas, poor country,"
IV,III,185,ROSS,1533-0.txt,3278,Almost afraid to know itself! It cannot
IV,III,186,ROSS,1533-0.txt,3279,"Be call’d our mother, but our grave, where nothing,"
IV,III,187,ROSS,1533-0.txt,3280,"But who knows nothing, is once seen to smile;"
IV,III,188,ROSS,1533-0.txt,3281,"Where sighs, and groans, and shrieks, that rent the air,"
IV,III,189,ROSS,1533-0.txt,3282,"Are made, not mark’d; where violent sorrow seems"
IV,III,190,ROSS,1533-0.txt,3283,A modern ecstasy. The dead man’s knell
IV,III,191,ROSS,1533-0.txt,3284,Is there scarce ask’d for who; and good men’s lives
IV,III,192,ROSS,1533-0.txt,3285,"Expire before the flowers in their caps,"
IV,III,193,ROSS,1533-0.txt,3286,Dying or ere they sicken.
IV,III,194,MACDUFF,1533-0.txt,3289,"O, relation"
IV,III,195,MACDUFF,1533-0.txt,3290,"Too nice, and yet too true!"
IV,III,196,MALCOLM,1533-0.txt,3293,What’s the newest grief?
IV,III,197,ROSS,1533-0.txt,3296,That of an hour’s age doth hiss the speaker;
IV,III,198,ROSS,1533-0.txt,3297,Each minute teems a new one.
IV,III,199,MACDUFF,1533-0.txt,3300,How does my wife?
IV,III,200,ROSS,1533-0.txt,3303,"Why, well."
IV,III,201,MACDUFF,1533-0.txt,3306,And all my children?
IV,III,202,ROSS,1533-0.txt,3309,Well too.
IV,III,203,MACDUFF,1533-0.txt,3312,The tyrant has not batter’d at their peace?
IV,III,204,ROSS,1533-0.txt,3315,No; they were well at peace when I did leave ’em.
IV,III,205,MACDUFF,1533-0.txt,3318,Be not a niggard of your speech: how goes’t?
IV,III,206,ROSS,1533-0.txt,3321,"When I came hither to transport the tidings,"
IV,III,207,ROSS,1533-0.txt,3322,"Which I have heavily borne, there ran a rumour"
IV,III,208,ROSS,1533-0.txt,3323,Of many worthy fellows that were out;
IV,III,209,ROSS,1533-0.txt,3324,"Which was to my belief witness’d the rather,"
IV,III,210,ROSS,1533-0.txt,3325,For that I saw the tyrant’s power afoot.
IV,III,211,ROSS,1533-0.txt,3326,Now is the time of help. Your eye in Scotland
IV,III,212,ROSS,1533-0.txt,3327,"Would create soldiers, make our women fight,"
IV,III,213,ROSS,1533-0.txt,3328,To doff their dire distresses.
IV,III,214,MALCOLM,1533-0.txt,3331,Be’t their comfort
IV,III,215,MALCOLM,1533-0.txt,3332,We are coming thither. Gracious England hath
IV,III,216,MALCOLM,1533-0.txt,3333,Lent us good Siward and ten thousand men;
IV,III,217,MALCOLM,1533-0.txt,3334,An older and a better soldier none
IV,III,218,MALCOLM,1533-0.txt,3335,That Christendom gives out.
IV,III,219,ROSS,1533-0.txt,3338,Would I could answer
IV,III,220,ROSS,1533-0.txt,3339,This comfort with the like! But I have words
IV,III,221,ROSS,1533-0.txt,3340,"That would be howl’d out in the desert air,"
IV,III,222,ROSS,1533-0.txt,3341,Where hearing should not latch them.
IV,III,223,MACDUFF,1533-0.txt,3344,What concern they?
IV,III,224,MACDUFF,1533-0.txt,3345,The general cause? or is it a fee-grief
IV,III,225,MACDUFF,1533-0.txt,3346,Due to some single breast?
IV,III,226,ROSS,1533-0.txt,3349,No mind that’s honest
IV,III,227,ROSS,1533-0.txt,3350,"But in it shares some woe, though the main part"
IV,III,228,ROSS,1533-0.txt,3351,Pertains to you alone.
IV,III,229,MACDUFF,1533-0.txt,3354,"If it be mine,"
IV,III,230,MACDUFF,1533-0.txt,3355,"Keep it not from me, quickly let me have it."
IV,III,231,ROSS,1533-0.txt,3358,"Let not your ears despise my tongue for ever,"
IV,III,232,ROSS,1533-0.txt,3359,Which shall possess them with the heaviest sound
IV,III,233,ROSS,1533-0.txt,3360,That ever yet they heard.
IV,III,234,MACDUFF,1533-0.txt,3363,Humh! I guess at it.
IV,III,235,ROSS,1533-0.txt,3366,Your castle is surpris’d; your wife and babes
IV,III,236,ROSS,1533-0.txt,3367,Savagely slaughter’d. To relate the manner
IV,III,237,ROSS,1533-0.txt,3368,"Were, on the quarry of these murder’d deer,"
IV,III,238,ROSS,1533-0.txt,3369,To add the death of you.
IV,III,239,MALCOLM,1533-0.txt,3372,Merciful heaven!— 
IV,III,240,MALCOLM,1533-0.txt,3373,"What, man! ne’er pull your hat upon your brows."
IV,III,241,MALCOLM,1533-0.txt,3374,Give sorrow words. The grief that does not speak
IV,III,242,MALCOLM,1533-0.txt,3375,"Whispers the o’er-fraught heart, and bids it break."
IV,III,243,MACDUFF,1533-0.txt,3378,My children too?
IV,III,244,ROSS,1533-0.txt,3381,"Wife, children, servants, all"
IV,III,245,ROSS,1533-0.txt,3382,That could be found.
IV,III,246,MACDUFF,1533-0.txt,3385,And I must be from thence!
IV,III,247,MACDUFF,1533-0.txt,3386,My wife kill’d too?
IV,III,248,ROSS,1533-0.txt,3389,I have said.
IV,III,249,MALCOLM,1533-0.txt,3392,Be comforted:
IV,III,250,MALCOLM,1533-0.txt,3393,"Let’s make us med’cines of our great revenge,"
IV,III,251,MALCOLM,1533-0.txt,3394,To cure this deadly grief.
IV,III,252,MACDUFF,1533-0.txt,3397,He has no children.— All my pretty ones?
IV,III,253,MACDUFF,1533-0.txt,3398,Did you say all?— O hell-kite!— All?
IV,III,254,MACDUFF,1533-0.txt,3399,"What, all my pretty chickens and their dam"
IV,III,255,MACDUFF,1533-0.txt,3400,At one fell swoop?
IV,III,256,MALCOLM,1533-0.txt,3403,Dispute it like a man.
IV,III,257,MACDUFF,1533-0.txt,3406,I shall do so;
IV,III,258,MACDUFF,1533-0.txt,3407,But I must also feel it as a man:
IV,III,259,MACDUFF,1533-0.txt,3408,"I cannot but remember such things were,"

V,VIII,21,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,4064,"Accursed be that tongue that tells me so,"
V,VIII,22,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,4065,For it hath cow’d my better part of man!
V,VIII,23,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,4066,"And be these juggling fiends no more believ’d,"
V,VIII,24,MACBETH,1533-0.txt,4067,That palter with us in a double sense;

V,VIII,41,SIWARD,1533-0.txt,4097,"Some must go off; and yet, by these I see,"
V,VIII,42,SIWARD,1533-0.txt,4098,So great a day as this is cheaply bought.
